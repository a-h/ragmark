# Watchkeeper Uncrewed Air System

Watchkeeper is a certified Uncrewed Aircraft System (UAS) equipped with a configurable intelligence and reconnaissance payload. Watchkeeper is operated by the Royal Artillery (RA) and maintained by the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME).

The system provides the Army’s Land Tactical Deep Find capability which is an essential element of the Future Land Combat System. Watchkeeper supports Corps and Divisional understanding and the ability to enable long-range targeting of enemy activity, during the day and at night.

It is built in the UK, and has been used successfully in Afghanistan, where it played a crucial protective role for British troops. Since the first flight in 2010, Watchkeeper has accumulated close to 4,000 flying hours.

## Its use

Watchkeeper is an intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR) asset, that can collect, process and disseminate high quality imagery intelligence as part of a layered and integrated ISTAR ecosystem. The radar can detect movement across thousands of square kilometres using Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) functionality and, in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode, it can provide high-quality images, including through cloud, from long ranges. It has day and night cameras with the power to identify targets from significant stand-off ranges and a laser sub-system for range-finding, target marking and target designation to support long-range strike. Radar and camera imagery from Watchkeeper can be networked to senior commanders and analysts, troops on the ground and to pass targets to other ISTAR assets or strike assets.

Watchkeeper is a system of systems, consisting of Air Vehicles (AV), Ground Control Stations (GCS), ground equipment for take-off and recovery, and Ground Data Terminals. It is designed to operate in range of ground and air conditions and is equipped to support a wide range of military and security missions. Uniquely, it’s high stand-off sensors and resilience communications systems make it survivable in high-threat environments while it’s certification means it can fly in the UK and in the full range of operations and theatres.

The Watchkeeper system was built in the UK by Thales, with a UK supply chain supporting British manufacturing jobs. The system has undergone rigorous flight testing in west Wales and continues to be developed and improved.

## Training

The 47th Regiment Royal Artillery, based at Larkhill, Wiltshire is responsible for Watchkeeper, with troops from that Regiment being trained in how to safely and effectively operate the system.

Troops undertake a bespoke UAS pilot training programme within the Regiment, with a pilots’ aptitude test selecting the best candidates to go forward for further training. A state-of-the-art simulator is used to train all pilots ahead of live flying which is currently being conducted in Fort Bliss, Texas. Fully qualified soldiers who have completed all necessary qualifications earn the prestigious Army Watchkeeper Pilot brevet (wings) to wear on their uniform.

Across the Regiment, soldiers and officers fulfil four main roles:

Aircrew: Pilots and mission controllers, supported by Image Analysts from the Intelligence Corps, fly the aircraft and deliver the mission.
Groundcrew: Groundcrew prepare, launch and recover the aircraft and ensure it is safe to fly.
Engineers: REME aviation engineers maintain all elements of the system in line with aviation engineering standards.
Support staff: Specialist flight operations, logistics and administration personnel provide essential support to the deployed detachment.
