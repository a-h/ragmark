# Unmanned Aerial Systems

## Watchkeeper

The Watchkeeper is the British Army's long range FIND capability and operates in all weathers with a combination of electro-optical, infrared and radar sensors.

It is normally operated at the Divisional level but can be utilised by Brigade's to gather vital information on the whereabouts of potential threats, non-combatants and friendly forces.

Watchkeeper provides situational awareness at the highest level for British Army formations and can also be employed for target acquisition and information operations such as collateral damage assessment.

## Desert Hawk

Desert Hawk is an extremely versatile and small Uncrewed Aerial System designed for discrete operations.

It is operated normally at the company level but is equally well employed above and below this. It has an extremely good record.

It provides an excellent 'over the hill' view for commanders on the ground.
