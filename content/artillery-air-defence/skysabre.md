# Sky Sabre

Sky Sabre, replacing its predecessor Rapier, is an air defence missile system comprising of three separate components: its radar, its command and control and its missiles.

It can control the flight of 24 missiles simultaneously whilst in flight, guiding them to intercept 24 separate targets.

Although pictured in the photograph together, in reality they would be expected to operate at distances of up to 15km apart. 

## Radar

The eyes and ears of the system is the Giraffe Agile Multi Beam 3D medium-range surveillance radar.

Its radar rotates atop an extending mast which allows it to be elevated above tree lines and other obstructions to identify low flying intruders.

The Giraffe can see a full 360 degrees out to a range of 120km.

## Command and Control

The second component is the Battle Management and Intelligence suite:the command and control centre. It links the radar with the missiles and sends them to their targets.

It also provides Link 16; a tactical datalink that allows Land Ceptor to share its information with Royal Navy vessels, the Royal Air Force, and our allies.

The system can be fully integrated with joint, combined, or NATO operations.

## Missiles

The third component is the Land Ceptor intelligent launcher and missile itself. At 99Kg each, the missiles are double the weight of the Rapier it replaces and have three times the range.

It is the Common Anti-Air Modular Missile (CAMM) that reaches speeds of 2300mph and can eliminate fighter aircraft, drones, and laser-guided smart bombs.
