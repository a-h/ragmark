# Personal Role Radio

The Personal Role Radio (PRR) is a small transmitter-receiver that allows infantry soldiers to communicate over short distances.

Effective even through thick cover or the walls of buildings, PRR enables section commanders to react quickly and efficiently to rapidly changing situations, including contact with the enemy, greatly increasing the effectiveness of infantry fire teams.

PRR is issued to every member of an eight-strong infantry section.

The system is easy to use, is unobtrusive and comfortable to wear yet is rugged enough to sustain the harshest environments.

The use of PRR has significantly enhanced combat effectiveness by providing all informed communications to front line soldiers, used alongside traditional methods based on shouting and hand signals.
