# Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS)

The M270B1 Multiple Launch Rocket System, firing the M31 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) munition, is the mainstay of the British Army's deep and shaping fires capability.

The system provides pinpoint accuracy, delivering a 200 lb high explosive warhead to its target with over twice the range of other artillery systems used by the British Army. The MLRS also represents the bulk of the Army's precision fires capability, with the GPS guidance capability integral to the system and highly accurate beyond 70 KM.

The weapon system is manned by a small crew of three Gunners and is mounted on a tracked armoured launcher, which is highly robust and manoeuvrable.

The circa £2Bn Land Deep Fires Programme (LDFP) is modernising and enhancing the Army’s Deep Fires capability in line with the Integrated Review 2021. The Chief of the General Staff has stated that modernised Land Deep Fires is one of his highest priority capabilities. 

Under the ‘One Launcher, Many Payloads’ vision, the UK’s aim is upgrade the fleet to deliver a state-of-the-art M270 A2 launcher. It's use will be expanded to two Regular regiments (3 Regiment Royal Horse Artillery and 26 Regiment Royal Artillery) and one Reserve regiment (101 Regiment Royal Artillery). It will be quipped with a suite of missiles to include: Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), Extended Range GMLRS (ER-G), Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) and Land Precision Strike (LPS). 

Additionally, the UK’s Technical Demonstrator 5 (TD5) project is developing alternative payloads (targeting at range using UAVs and Area Effect (multiple warheads for inclusion into ER-G and PrSM)).

## Rate of fire

The GMLRS fires surface-to-surface rockets and the army tactical missile system (ATACMS). Without leaving the cab, the crew of three (driver, gunner and section chief) can fire up to 12 rockets in less than 60 seconds.

The GMLRS launcher unit is loaded with 12 rockets, packaged in two six-rocket pods. The launcher, which is mounted on a stretched Bradley chassis, is a highly automated self-loading and self-aiming system. It contains a fire control computer that integrates the vehicle and rocket-launching operations.

The rockets can be fired individually or in ripples of two to 12. Accuracy is maintained in all firing modes because the computer re-aims the launcher between rounds.
